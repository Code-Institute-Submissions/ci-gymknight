## UX
 
### User stories

游늷 As a user I want to access the website, browse and read a post

游늷 As a user I want to sort all posts on the website alphabetically, by date, or popularity

游늷 As a user I want to search for a particular post

游늷 As a user I want to be able to see the author of the post I am reading and other posts that visit their blog

游늷 As a user I want to register and create my own blog

游늷 As a user I want to be able to change my blog description and password

游늷 As a user I want to post posts to my blog

游늷 As a user I want to be able to edit and delete my own posts

### Strategy

The main design goal is to provide users with clean and sleek website with easy-to-read textual content that is meaningfully organised.

### Scope

For readers Bloggy is a way to read about their favourite topics and for creators, Bloggy is a way to put their content out there for the world to see.

### Structure

Index page features a jumbotron with a slogan of "Home of the blogs you love" and a action button. This action button will either bring the user to the login/register page if they're not logged in or it will read 'Write a new post' if the user is authenticated and will bring them to a page where user is able to write a new post. Underneath the jumbotron, users are able to search for posts by title, description or text within, and are able to sort all the posts visible on the home page by: Newest first, oldest first, title (A-Z), title (Z-A) & popularity (based on number of views).

Search page contains a search bar with search and cancel buttons underneath which found posts are displayed.

Single post page contains the post title & post author details at the top with creator's profile picture and a link to visit their profile/blog. Underneath that is the post image supplied by the user and finally the body of the post.

Profile page/Blog page displays user's blog title & description as well as user's profile picture. Underneath that, all of user's posts are displayed. 

Edit profile page features a form where user is asked for their current password, new password and confirmation of the new password (if they wish to change their password), and a field where they can edit their profile image.

Login page contains simple login form that prompts user for their username and password. Users that aren't registered yet are invited to register underneath the form.

Register form contains seven form fields that asks user for:
1. Username
2. Profile picture URL
3. Email address
4. Blog title
5. Blog description
6. Password & 
7. Repeat of their password

reCAPTCHA is utilised to check that user is not a robot.

Create a post page is a form page that that asks user to input:
* Desired post title
* Post description 
* Body of their post
* Post image URL 
* Read time (in minutes)

2. A code editor of your choice such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). 
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to pull data from github
4. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store data into the database (note you'll need to create one on your own using details provided below)

Once all this is in place follow the steps below:
1. Clone this git repo using GIT CLI:
    *  `git clone https://github.com/ib-skoric/ci-bloggy.git`
2. Create `env.py` file that contains correct MONGO_URI and login credentials as well as all SECRET KEY values required for CAPTCHA & other modules
3. Run `FLASK_APP=run.py` & `FLASK_ENV=development` or alternatively create a `flaskenv` file with these commands
4. Install all required modules from the `requirements.txt` file:
    * `sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt`
5. Sign up for a free MongoDB account via this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new collection called __bloggy__ (note all lowercase letters)

### To deploy remotely

I've personally used [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to deploy this project for submission. The below steps explain how I deployed my app to Heroku. If you're using a different platform to deploy your app, please check and follow relevant documentation.

1. Register for a free account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
2. Create requirements.txt file so they can be installed on Heroku once deployed
* `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
3. Create Procfile (case sensitive) to inform Heroku what type of application is being deployed
* `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` or alternatively create a Procfile with this line of code using your GUI/IDE.
4. Log into your Heroku account and choose New -> Create new app
5. Input your name (must be unique) and choose region closest to you.
6. After app is created, Heroku will automatically bring you to *Deploy* tab. Under *Deployment Method* choose Github. If you haven't already log into your GitHub account and grant Heroku access to your GitHub data.
7. Type in your repository name and click search, once found, click *Connect*
8. Very imporant part is to declare Config Vars for your app under *Settings* -> *Reveal config vars*
9. Config Vars for this app are:

    | Config Var       | Value   
    | -------------     |:-------------:| 
    | IP               | 0.0.0.0
    | PORT           | 5000
    | DEBUG        | False or True (False for production)
    | MONGO_URI        | Your unique Mongo URI goes here
    | MONGO_DBNAME        | bloggy
    | SECRET_KEY       | Your unique secret key
    | RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY | Your unique public key supplied by Google
    | RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY | Your unique private key supplied by Google
